# DoraHacks Light-Weight MACI

DoraHacks MACI is a light-weight implementation of MACI. It is integrated with the DoraHacks platform to provide private, collusion-resistant voting infrastructure for hackathons, quadratic voting / quadratic funding rounds. However, we are trying to make it portable, so that it can be integrated by other protocols / products for anti-collusion / privacy-preserving purposes.

ETHDenver 22 MACI community voting will be live on Feb 20th MDT at hackerlink.io/grant/ethdenver22.

This repo is built based on MACI 1.0 from @PrivacyScaling.

Repo details to be updated soon.
